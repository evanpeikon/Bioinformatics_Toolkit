## ðŸ§¬ Bioinformatics Tutorials
- [Introduction to Functional Enrichment Analysis](https://github.com/evanpeikon/functional_enrichment_analysis): A DIY guide to gene ontology, pathway, and gene set enrichment analysis
- [From Genes to Networks: Uncovering Biological Insights through Protein-Protein Interactions](https://github.com/evanpeikon/PPI_Network_Analysis): Mapping DEGs to PPI Networks, Identifying Network Hubs and Highly Connected Proteins, and Simulating Genetic Circuits.
- [Unraveling Gene Co-Expression Networks: Insights into Transcriptional Regulation](https://github.com/evanpeikon/co_expression_network): A DIY guide to gene co-expression network analysis
- [BLAST - The Biological Search Engine](https://github.com/evanpeikon/BLAST): A DIY Guide To BLAST Tools For Sequence Alignment
- [Identifying and Visualizing Marker Genes with ScanPy](https://github.com/evanpeikon/scRNA-Seq-ScanPy)
- [An Introduction To Dynamical Systems & Markov Models](https://github.com/evanpeikon/dynamicalsys)
- [Decoding The Viral Proteome](https://github.com/evanpeikon/viral-proteome): Decoding the herpes virus proteome and analyzing amino acid frequencies to uncover potential drug targets
- [Amiloride in Multiple Myeloma: A Deep Dive into RNA-Seq Data Analysis](https://github.com/evanpeikon/GSE_95077): In this project, I analyzed RNA-sequencing data from the study titled "Amiloride, An Old Diuretic Drug, Is a Potential Therapeutic Agent for Multiple Myeloma" to gain a deeper understanding of Amiloride's mechanism of action and its impact on gene expression. The analysis focused on identifying differentially expressed genes and exploring their physiological roles in the context of multiple myeloma treatment.
- [Investigating Transcriptional Changes in Alzheimer's Disease Using a 3xTg-AD Mouse Model](https://github.com/evanpeikon/GSE_161904): In this project, I present an analysis of bulk RNA-sequencing data from the 3xTg-AD mouse model, a widely used model for studying Alzheimerâ€™s disease. The objective for this project is to investigate the molecular changes that occur in the insular cortex as the disease advances, with a focus on identifying key transcriptional regulators and pathways that contribute to cognitive decline.
- [Exploring mutual features between the 5xFAD, 3xTG-AD, and PS3O1S Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Models](https://github.com/evanpeikon/mouse_AD_models): The purpose of this project is to explore the similarities, differences, and overlapping featuresâ€”including differentially expressed genes (DEGs), Gene Ontology (GO) terms, biological pathways, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networksâ€”between three mutant mouse models of Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD).
